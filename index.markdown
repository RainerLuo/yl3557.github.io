Welcome to my new website! My name is [Yihao (Rainer) Luo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yihao-rainer-luo-ba1862180/), and I am a biker, data scientist, and a current student at Cornell University. I created this website to share my adventures, insights, and interests with you.

As a biker, I have travelled to various places around the world, from the remote and depopulated areas of Tibet and Northern Canada to the bustling cities of Tokyo and New York. These experiences have taught me a great deal about life, culture, and myself. On this website, I will share my stories and pictures, and hopefully inspire you to explore the world around you.

As a data scientist, I am passionate about using data to gain insights and solve problems. I will share some of my projects and findings on this website, as well as tips and tutorials on data science.

As a Cornell student, I am constantly learning and growing. I will share my academic pursuits, extracurricular activities, and campus life on this website, and hopefully connect with other students and scholars.

Thank you for visiting my website, and I hope you will enjoy the content!
