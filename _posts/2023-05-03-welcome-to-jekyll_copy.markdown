As a biker, I have always had a thirst for adventure and a desire to explore the world on two wheels. Over the past few years, I have embarked on some truly epic journeys, covering more than 27,000 kilometers and venturing to some of the most remote and depopulated places on the planet.

At 14 years old, I was going through a tough time, as I was being bullied at school and had no friends. Feeling trapped and isolated in my hometown, I decided to start anew in Canada. When I was 15, I purchased a one-way ticket to Vancouver, which is now my home. It is also where my preferred name, Rainer, came from, inspired by the rainy days of the city.

To take control of my life, I got on my bike and set out to explore the world around me. Initially, it was a way to escape my problems and the difficulties I faced at school. However, as I traveled further from home, I started to experience a shift in my perspective.

As I explored the remote and sparsely populated regions while riding through the countryside, I started to experience a newfound sense of liberation and self-empowerment. I no longer identified with the bullied child from my birthplace, which I do not consider my home anymore. Instead, I saw myself as a biker, a traveler, and an adventurer. Through my journeys, I discovered that I possessed more potential than I had ever envisioned, and I started to prove it to myself with every mile that I covered.

To help combat bullying, I began participating in anti-bullying events in Vancouver using my bike as a way to draw attention. Since I was still too self-conscious to show my face publicly due to the long-term effects of bullying, I opted to wear pink during these events to stand in solidarity with the cause.

When I was 16, I decided to embark on a journey from Chengdu to Lhasa - a daunting 2400 kilometer trip that would take me across multiple mountains with elevations of over 4000 feet. However, when I arrived in Tibet, it was rainy season and the roads had been severely damaged. I was told that it would take at least a month for the roads to be repaired and everyone in my team decided to return home. But I refused to give up on my journey.

Instead, as a determined 16-year-old, I made a difficult decision to take a 1000-kilometer detour and venture across a more remote, depopulated and rural path to reach my destination. It wasn't easy - the terrain was rugged and the weather unpredictable, but I persevered.

Despite facing various challenges and hardships, including the need to navigate unfamiliar terrain, braving harsh weather conditions and dealing with isolation, I remained steadfast in my pursuit. Eventually, after many days of navigating the wilderness, I successfully made it to Lhasa.

As I approached graduation from the University of Toronto, I realized that my motivations for traveling had changed. It was no longer about proving myself or escaping from my problems. Instead, I wanted to truly immerse myself in the beauty of the world around me.

To celebrate my graduation, I decided to embark on a journey from Vancouver to Whitehorse, Yukon, a small town in Northern Canada near the Arctic Circle. It was a trip that would take me across some of the most remote and depopulated areas of the country.

As I set out on my journey, I felt a sense of excitement and adventure. The open road stretched out before me, and I was ready to take on whatever challenges lay ahead.

The first leg of my journey took me through the mountains of British Columbia. As I rode through the winding roads and past towering peaks, I couldn't help but feel a sense of awe at the sheer beauty of the landscape.

As I rode my bike through the remote town of Gitanyow, B.C., I searched for a suitable place to set up camp for the night. The only flat ground I could find was in the burial ground of the Canadian First Nations. As I lay my sleeping bag on the ground, I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. But I had no other options.

I set up my tent and started cooking my dinner on the portable stove. Suddenly, the rain began to pour down heavily. I quickly gathered all my belongings and rushed into the tent to keep myself dry. The sound of the raindrops hitting the tent was soothing, and I fell asleep to the sound of the rain.

Later that evening, the sun began to set, and I noticed a rainbow forming in the sky. It was 11:00 pm, and the sky was still bright due to the northern summer. I stood there, mesmerized by the beauty of the scene before me. It was a moment that I would never forget.

As I left Gitanyow the next day, I couldn't help but feel grateful for the experiences I had on my journey. From the challenges to the breathtaking views, each moment had taught me something new and helped me grow as a person.

But as I continued north, the scenery began to change. The forests gave way to barren tundra, and the mountains turned into rolling hills. The roads became less and less traveled, and I often found myself riding for hours without seeing another soul.

Despite the challenges, I pressed on. There was something exhilarating about being so far from civilization, about feeling truly alone in the wilderness.

Finally, after weeks of riding, I arrived in Whitehorse. The town was small and quiet, but there was a sense of warmth and community that I had never experienced before. I spent a few days there, exploring the surrounding wilderness and getting to know some of the locals.

Looking back on those early days of my career as a biker, I realize that I was searching for something more than just an escape from my problems. I was looking for a way to prove myself, to show the world and myself that I was capable of great things. And in the end, that's exactly what I found. By embracing the freedom of the open road, I discovered my own strength, my own courage, and my own sense of purpose. And though my travels have taken me far from my hometown, I will always be grateful for the journey that began when I was just a 14-year-old kid with a bike and a dream.
