I am a driven individual with a strong passion for data science, machine learning, and biking. Currently, I am pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Operations Research and Information Engineering from Cornell University, and I am set to graduate in May. After graduation, I am excited to begin my journey as a Data Scientist at the Royal Bank of Canada.

My academic background and research interests have equipped me with the necessary skills to excel in the field of data science. I have worked on projects involving time-series forecasting, natural language processing, and optimization. I am proficient in programming languages such as Python, R, and SQL and have experience working with popular data science tools such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.

Outside of academics, I am an avid biker and have completed several long-distance trips. These journeys have taught me the importance of perseverance, problem-solving, and teamwork. These values have helped me in my academic and professional pursuits and have shaped me into the driven individual I am today.

 As an upcoming Data Scientist at the Royal Bank of Canada, I am thrilled to be starting on May 29th, 2023. This role has been a long-term aspiration of mine since high school, as it provides me with the opportunity to combine my academic learnings from Rotman Commerce and Cornell Engineering to make a positive impact. I am eager to utilize my skills and experience to contribute to the innovative and impactful work being done at RBC, and to continuously learn and grow within the organization.

 This project involved the construction of a data pipeline using Dataiku and AWS to integrate a dataset containing comments from J&J's sales team into a newly established sales assistance system. Various natural language models were applied to the comments to analyze their sentiments and topics. The model outputs were validated and converted into actionable insights to improve the performance of the system. Dataiku and Tableau were used to build visualization dashboards to communicate the insights to stakeholders.

In "The Value of Social Networks: A Quantitative Estimation," regression models were used to analyze salary discrepancies between Rotman MBA graduates who arrived in Canada at different stages of life over time. The insights provided highlighted the intangible value of social networks. To achieve this, over 2000 Rotman graduates' demographic information and job title evolution were scraped from LinkedIn, and a classification method was innovated to match over 80% of self-reported job titles to the title-salary dataset scraped from Glassdoor. This method was used to estimate the salary paths for Rotman MBA graduates.

In "Gender Congruity in Entrepreneurship," data from over 100,000 listed companies and demographic information of over 300,000 top executives were collected, aggregated, and cleaned to determine the gender attributions of companies' top executives and the industries represented. The impact of industry-management gender congruency on investors' decision-making process was analyzed. Relevant papers in the field were researched and succinct literature reviews were written to communicate findings with the supervisor.

During my time at the University of Toronto, I excelled academically and was recognized as a Dean's List Scholar for two consecutive years. I gained a solid foundation in probability and statistics, linear algebra, and methods in data analysis. Additionally, I developed an understanding of finance through courses in corporate finance, investments, and accounting. I also delved into more advanced topics, such as time series analysis and introduction to machine learning.

In my high school years, I underwent a significant transformation that influenced my career path and personal development. Relocating to Vancouver from an environment where I was bullied had a profound impact on me. It shaped my personality and motivated me to pursue a career in Canada. Ultimately, this decision led me to work at the Royal Bank of Canada and continues to inspire me to make a positive difference in my community.
